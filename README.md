LSTM is a type of neural network that excels at processing sequential data, making it ideal for analyzing stock prices over time. By training an LSTM model on historical stock market data, we can make predictions about future market trends and adjust our investments accordingly.
But predictive analysis is only half the battle. It's also crucial to manage risk effectively to protect our investments. By combining LSTM with risk management strategies, we can minimize potential losses and optimize our returns.
I have used yfinance library to import the stock data for various TATA-owned companies to predict their risk and expected returns.
I have also tried to develop a model using LSTM to predict the closing price of the stocks with an RMSE of 3.25.
